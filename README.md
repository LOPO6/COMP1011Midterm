This is my Midterm exam for my Advanced Java Class that took place in Fall of 2024, It involves taking information from a separate sql file and displaying it in scenebuilder. There are also different settings available to filter the data based on different parameters. Please note that the sql server that was used for the exam was provided by the professor and is no longer available, so the data will not be properly displayed (because the server does not exist anymore). The Java code is still fine though.
